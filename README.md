<h2>USE CASE:</h2>
<ul>
<li>play multiple instances emulator games at the same time </li>
<li>use as a foundation for interesting XOR (and or) NAND controlling (when playing same game with a friend , requires 2 inputs) </li>
<li>What I really want to do is give control to an ai to do the same as above ;) - but each virtual controller will have additional inputs from ai ;D </li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>
In short: replicates my xbox controller in linux to register multiple virtual controllers.
