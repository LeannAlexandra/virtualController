# VirtualController || AIPlayerController

The virtual controller is created as a system wide input device [currently only in my linux environment] that can be used like an api to control certain elements of movement or in games. currently it is kind of like a macro player but for a gaming controller. 

## How to use
The main file shows you what you need to do in shorthand
The Makefile is an overengineered masterpiece that will compile anything you put into the /src & /include folders. 

## Use Case: 
- You have an idea for an ai to play a game! - now you can let controll it with code. 
- You just want to enjoy a relaxing cup of coffee but you don't want to mess up your shiny hunting expedition, plus you're a purist and no cheat code || genned pokemon will cut it* - and this can do exactly that. (I'm working on that project btw) 

*well if this is you, you are probably playing the OG game on the OG console.
